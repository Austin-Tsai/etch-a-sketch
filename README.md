# Pix-Art
---
Project made to practice CSS, HTML, and JS (mainly using flexbox and manipulating DOM elements) 
following the Odin Project Foundations Course, originally as etch-a-sketch

Many additional details were added for practice and now it can be used to create pixel art

Switch between draw, eraser, bucket, and rainbow modes  
Shift click with the eraser and rainbow modes active to have a bucket effect

Hotkeys are:  
(1) color eye dropper  
(2) color picker
(3) draw  
(4) eraser  
(5) bucket  
(6) rainbow  
(7) toggle background image  
(ctrl+z/cmd+z) undo  
(ctrl+y/cmd+y) redo  
Download the image when you're done (use the change download pixel size button for a larger/smaller image)

Fun Fact: All of the custom cursors, the background, and the favicon were made in this website

*Colors seem to break if using a dark mode extension like Dark Reader so disable those
